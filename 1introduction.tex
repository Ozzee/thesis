\section{Scope}
\label{section:scope}

The scope of the literature review will be existing literature on lean software projects, comparing these to find similarities if there are any.

Scope of the empirical study will be one lean software development project. The project will be studied from the point of view of developers, customers and end-users. The thesis is limited to one case study.

\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{section:structure}

This section presents the structure of the thesis.\\

\fixme{Write these a bit smoother once the structure is done}

Chapter \ref{chapter:background} presents the origin of the lean philosophy. It goes through the development of lean principles from manufacturing to software development.

Chapter \ref{chapter:litterature} covers the existing literature on lean software development. In this chapter experiences of previous lean software projects are analyzed and compared. This is done in order to find some common trends or best practices to use in projects. These common trends and best practices are compared in order to later compare them with the findings of the empirical study, which are presented in chapter \ref{chapter:discussion}.

Chapter \ref{chapter:methods} goes through the methods used in the empirical study. The participants and their roles are presented as well as the practical arrangements regarding interviews.

Chapter \ref{chapter:empirical} presents the results of the empirical study. The data is analyzed and the results of that analysis are presented.

Chapter \ref{chapter:discussion} discusses the results gathered from the empirical study and their implications. This is done by analyzing the relationship between the data gathered from the empirical study and the literature review presented int chapter \ref{chapter:litterature}.

Chapter \ref{chapter:conclusions} presents the conclusions of this thesis and suggestions for further research.
